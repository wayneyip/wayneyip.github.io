    title: "Applied to Selected Layers Only",
    text: "Despite being a fullscreen effect, the outlines are applied only to opaques in the Character layer, allowing characters to stand out in the visual hierarchy. I achieved the layer mask by writing a custom renderer feature in C#."

    imgSrc: "work_pixelart.png", 
    title: "Perpendicular Fade",
    text: "To further reduce noise, leaf planes fade out when their sides face the camera. Because their normals are already overwritten by the sphere, I reconstructed their normals in the shader using the cross product of partial derivatives (ddx and ddy)."

    imgSrc: "work_pixelart.png", 
    title: "Foreground Darkening",
    text: "Foliage is darkened near the camera, giving a nice definition to the foreground. To get a stepped color gradient, I smoothstepped and posterized the depth value."
